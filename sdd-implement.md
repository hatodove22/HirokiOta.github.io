# SDD Implement — 2025-09-30 (UI JA pass)

## Task List
[x] Provide editor copy fallback via shared helper (i18n update pending upstream).
[x] Refactor `NewsEditor` to consume i18n copy and update JA placeholders.
[x] Adjust preview panel overflow/sticky handling.
[x] Verify translation usage and preview anchoring; log unresolved build issue if persists.

## Notes
- Keep Language toggle copy aligned with new translations.
- Preview panel overlay button already localized via `preview` copy.
