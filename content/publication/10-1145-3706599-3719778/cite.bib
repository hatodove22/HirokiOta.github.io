 abstract = {We present FresnelDeformable, a novel approach for conveying the softness of virtual objects by combining pseudo-stiffness with dynamic fingertip plane tilt manipulation. Our method leverages a custom device equipped with servo motors that tilt each fingertip contact surface according to the user’s applied force, aligning the tactile feedback with the visually simulated deformation of a virtual object. In a pilot user study, we compared three types of visual stimuli (compressible, deformable, and no-deformation) and two tactile conditions (with and without tilt) to evaluate their effects on perceived softness, realism, and visuo-tactile coherence. The results showed that tilt manipulation significantly increased the coherence between visual and tactile cues, and also suggested a moderate-to-large effect on softness perception. These findings imply that orienting the fingertip contact plane can complement existing pseudo-stiffness techniques, expanding the range of perceived softness in virtual environments.},
