abstract: We present FresnelDeformable, a novel approach for conveying the softness
  of virtual objects by combining pseudo-stiffness with dynamic fingertip plane tilt
  manipulation. Our method leverages a custom device equipped with servo motors that
  tilt each fingertip contact surface according to the user’s applied force, aligning
  the tactile feedback with the visually simulated deformation of a virtual object.
  In a pilot user study, we compared three types of visual stimuli (compressible,
  deformable, and no-deformation) and two tactile conditions (with and without tilt)
  to evaluate their effects on perceived softness, realism, and visuo-tactile coherence.
  The results showed that tilt manipulation significantly increased the coherence
  between visual and tactile cues, and also suggested a moderate-to-large effect on
  softness perception. These findings imply that orienting the fingertip contact plane
  can complement existing pseudo-stiffness techniques, expanding the range of perceived
  softness in virtual environments.
