## Background
We aim to make users naturally feel properties such as stiffness, shifting weight, and inertia of grasped virtual objects with their fingertips and palm. Our approach is to change the tilt of small fingertip contact planes in real-time to evoke these sensations.

## Approach
The handheld device embeds three small motors and force sensors and actively controls the tilt (±45°) of the contact planes under each fingertip. By reading the user’s grip force and synchronizing with hand motion in Unity, the system expresses sensations like stiffness, center-of-mass shift, and rotational inertia in VR while remaining compact and self-contained.
