## Background
Hap'n'Roll explores a scroll‑inspired mechanism to deliver diverse haptics with a single actuator.

## Approach
By combining rotation and winding, it switches tactile cues such as friction, impacts, and bumps.

## Benefits
The mechanism is compact and simple, enabling multiple sensations from one device.
