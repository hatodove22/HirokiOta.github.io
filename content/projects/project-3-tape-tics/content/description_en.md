## Background
Rapid exploration of multi-point vibrotactile layouts is hindered by wiring and enclosures.

## Approach
We designed a cuttable tape-like device with small motors and LEDs mounted at equal intervals on a flexible PCB strip.

## Benefits
Simply stick it to surfaces to build multi-point tactile patterns. It accelerates education and XR prototyping.
