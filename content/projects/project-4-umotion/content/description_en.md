# UMotion — Robust full‑body motion from wearables only

## Background
We aim to reconstruct human motion accurately even where cameras are hard to use.

## Approach
We fuse orientation/acceleration with inter‑sensor distance while considering uncertainty to suppress drift over time.

## Benefits
Using distance reduces pose ambiguities and stabilizes estimates.

## Contribution
We developed a new, ~30g lightweight wearable sensor device prototype.
