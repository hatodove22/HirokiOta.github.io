# Medical AI Research Lab Notes

## Insights from Clinical Practice

Based on discussions with cooperating physicians and technicians in clinical settings, we reviewed our experimental design and evaluation metrics.

### Main Improvements

1. **Review of Evaluation Metrics**
   - Added clinically meaningful metrics
   - Emphasized the balance between sensitivity and specificity

2. **Dataset Expansion**
   - Include more diverse cases
   - Consider age and gender balance

## Organizing Improvement Tasks

We are organizing future improvement plans, including results from hyperparameter exploration and failure cases.

### Next Steps

- [ ] Model architecture optimization
- [ ] Consideration of data augmentation methods
- [ ] Implementation of real-time processing

## Summary

Through collaboration with clinical practice, we have made progress toward developing more practical AI systems.
