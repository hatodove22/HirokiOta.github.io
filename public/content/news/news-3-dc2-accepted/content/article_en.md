# DC2 Research Fellowship Accepted!

I have been accepted as a Research Fellow (DC) by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) in 2025.

## Research Project

The research project I applied for is titled "Development of Tactile Display Systems Responsive to User Expectations" and consists of the following three components.

#### Component 1: Development and Evaluation of Handheld Devices for Diverse Tactile Presentation through Fingertip Contact Plane Tilting

This component aims to develop a handheld device that can present various tactile information through active tilting by the user's fingertips. Unlike conventional fixed devices, allowing users to actively manipulate the device is expected to provide richer tactile experiences.

#### Component 2: Development and Evaluation of Tactile Stimulus Switching Systems Based on User Expectations (Tactile Exploration Behavior)

This component involves developing a system that predicts what tactile information users expect and dynamically switches the presented stimuli accordingly. By analyzing tactile exploration behavior, we aim to infer user intentions and achieve optimal tactile presentation.

#### Component 3: Simplification of Tactile Display Devices Using Tactile Illusions

This component aims to develop devices that can present diverse tactile information while reducing the number of physical actuators by utilizing tactile illusion mechanisms. This will enable device miniaturization and cost reduction.

## Future Research

Through this research, I aim to realize more natural and intuitive tactile interfaces. In particular, by understanding user intentions and providing tactile presentation accordingly, I believe we can offer unprecedented new tactile experiences.

I will continue to work hard on this research.
