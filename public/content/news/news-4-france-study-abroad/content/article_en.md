# Study Abroad in France!

From October 2024, I spent six months studying abroad at INRIA/IRISA, a national research institute in France.

## About the Host Institution

INRIA (Institut National de Recherche en Informatique et en Automatique) is France's national research institute for computer science and automation. IRISA (Institut de Recherche en Informatique et Systèmes Aléatoires) is one of INRIA's research centers, conducting research in computer science and systems.

## Research Activities

During my stay, I primarily conducted research on haptics (tactile technology). Haptics is a technology that provides tactile feedback to users and has applications in various fields such as virtual reality and remote operation systems.

## Supervisor

I was supervised by Lendy Mulot during my stay. Mulot is a leading expert in the field of haptics and has published numerous research achievements. I received valuable guidance and advice, which helped broaden my research perspective.

## Support for the Study Abroad

This study abroad was supported by the NAIST GRANITE project. The GRANITE project aims to promote international research exchange and nurture young researchers. I am very grateful for this opportunity.

## What I Learned

Through six months of study abroad in France, I learned research methodologies in different cultures and research environments. Additionally, through interactions with international researchers, I was able to diversify my research perspective. I am confident that this experience will be highly valuable for my future research activities.
