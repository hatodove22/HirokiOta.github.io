## Background
Wearables that convey cues and textures via vibration are increasing, but quickly trying many multi‑point layouts at arbitrary positions/lengths is burdensome due to wiring and enclosures. Tape‑tics reduces this overhead by arranging vibrators and LEDs on a flexible “tape” that can be cut to length and stuck on curved surfaces, aiming at classrooms and XR prototyping where many patterns must be tried in a short time.

## Approach
Small coin motors and full‑color LEDs are mounted at equal intervals on a narrow flexible PCB strip. Each node can be individually controlled (vibration intensity and lighting). The controller is wireless (BLE) and a GUI sets intensities, colors, and order. The strip can be cut and rejoined, following clothing and curved surfaces. Like tape LEDs, it lets you build multi‑point tactile patterns simply by sticking it on, without messy wiring.

## Benefits
You can focus on the substance of tactile design rather than wiring/enclosures. Because it adheres along curved surfaces, it’s easy to iterate placements on body parts such as arms, hands, and back; together with LEDs, it supports “visible haptics.” In hands‑on sessions, participants created patterns via the GUI and reported improved understanding.
