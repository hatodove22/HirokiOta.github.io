## Background
Devices that let users discriminate object “shape,” “size,” and “texture” in the hand tend to be complex and heavy. Hap’n’Roll leverages a “scroll” idea to deliver diverse haptics with just a single motor.

## Approach
The device consists of two shafts, a single sheet, and a single motor. By changing the number of windings, the perceived thickness under the hand varies continuously, enabling small/medium/large sizes. Holes to fix fingertips on the sheet generate multiple shapes beyond a cylinder, e.g., rectangular, conical, and cup‑like. Different materials attached to the sheet allow switching textures as you scroll.

## Benefits
User studies showed three sizes and four shapes can be presented. Accuracy was about 76.1% for shape+size and 98.5% for shape only. Because one motor covers shape, size, and texture, the mechanism stays lightweight and simple while delivering rich haptic experiences and easier prototyping.

## Future Work
We plan libraries of shapes/textures, faster switching control, and integration into VR/AR, training, and rehabilitation scenarios. The intuitive “scroll to choose haptics” operation could become a new standard for portable haptic interfaces.
