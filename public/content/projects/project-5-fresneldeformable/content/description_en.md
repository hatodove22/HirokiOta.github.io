## Goal
We aim to convey “softness” more convincingly with a light and simple mechanism. Without large hardware, we combine visual and tactile cues to enhance plausibility when touching.

## Approach
We slightly tilt a small fingertip contact plane according to the applied force. In VR, users see a virtual object deform (apparent stiffness) while feeling the tilt change at the fingertip. These two small cues create an illusion of holding a soft object.

## Device Image
Three small contact planes for thumb, index, and middle fingers are angle‑controlled by compact motors. The pushing force is coarsely estimated, and the tilt switches accordingly. The device is lightweight and easy to mount on existing controllers.

## Benefits
With just visual deformation and fingertip tilt, we can enhance softness expression without complex mechanisms, improving visuo‑haptic consistency and immersion. It is easy to use where mechanical constraints are strict, such as education, demos, and exhibitions.

## Outlook
We will further miniaturize and reduce power, broaden combinations with existing VR/haptic devices, and improve automatic switching of tilt control based on user actions.
